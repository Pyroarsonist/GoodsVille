# GoodsVille

## Description

*GoodsVille*  - online platform implemented on the basis of an auction. Each user can submit their bids. Each lot has its own room. In order to be able to bid, you need to confirm your participation in the room with an interested lot. This can be done before bidding, time which was set by lot's author. The room stores in itself: information about the lot, the start time of the auction and the list of participants. Participants receive a notification of the beginning and end of bidding. If no bids have been made, then the bidding is postponed and a notification about a new time is sent to all participants with a proposal to refuse to bid for this lot.

## Implementation Features
